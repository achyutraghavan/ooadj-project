# meal-planner
This is a simple daily meal planning app that makes use of the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to get a meal plan for a single day based on calorie and dietary requirements.

The app is implemented using Spring Boot with Thymeleaf and Webflux.  The project can be downloaded and easily imported into Spring STS to be run.
